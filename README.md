This is the pre-alpha version of PinyinType, built on Rails, novel Javascript, and PostgreSQL. In its current state, the user can either practice on a sentence of their own choice or the default sentence, and they can play back either the sound for each individual word or the entire sentence.

Features that need implementing:

* Multi-sentence/line support

* Improved definition output formatting

* Softer transitions between colors

* More resilient sentence parsing

* Performance improvements
